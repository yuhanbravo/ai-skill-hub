- Updated at: `2026-06-11`
- Scope: `ai-skill-hub`
- Method: `system-status-update` wrapper over `update-project-status`
- Config: `.codex/skill-config/update-project-status.json`
- Data sources: Git history through PR #17 squash merge commit `fd6cf10`, working tree, `skills/`, `.agents/`, `.github/`, `tools/`, `docs/status/`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`, and P1-A / P1-B / P1-C post-merge closeout facts supplied by the maintainer.

## Layer Status

### Canonical Skill Layer (`skills/`)

- Status: `stable`
- `skills/` remains the sole canonical source of truth.
- PR #12 is merged into `main` at `981fdb94d0bad2eaec58addf717effdac1b2ec40`.
- PR #12 completes the P0 first batch of canonical skill prompt / template / example entrypoint cleanup for `workflow-bootstrap`, `financial-data-project-migration`, `system-status-update`, and `system-handoff`.
- DeepSeek review configuration closeout is complete.
- P1 examples coverage is complete after PR #15, PR #16, and PR #17 merged into `main`.
- This closeout records the merged state only; it does not reopen P0, DeepSeek configuration, or P1 examples coverage.

### Prompt / Template / Example Asset Layer

- Status: `stable-to-evolving`
- Reusable prompt entrypoints are clearer after PR #12.
- Heavy generated-output structures are easier to discover from `templates/` instead of being embedded as prompt prose.
- `workflow-bootstrap` now has a project-level post-dev dual-refresh prompt and a GitHub PR bootstrap prompt.
- `financial-data-project-migration` now separates the first executable migration task package template from the first executable migration task package prompt.
- `system-status-update` now owns the system-level status-first linked refresh prompt.
- `system-handoff` now has clearer receiver-side examples and entry references for status-baseline-driven handoff refreshes.
- P1-A expanded `chatgpt-handoff-pilot` invocation examples in PR #15 at commit `8a734ff`.
- P1-B expanded `project-takeover` invocation examples in PR #16 at commit `ae97ab4` and tightened limited-scope / scoped-reuse wording before merge.
- P1-C expanded `skill-governance` invocation examples in PR #17 at commit `fd6cf10`, including the post-review Skill Refactor boundary tightening.

### Workflow Bootstrap Layer

- Status: `stable-to-evolving`
- `workflow-bootstrap` remains the project-level orchestration owner for role-chain and thin project-side workflow guidance.
- The GitHub PR bootstrap prompt is aligned with the canonical orchestration contract after Copilot review corrections to authorization flags: `commit`, `push`, `pr`, and `comment`.
- This layer continues to route implementation evidence and closeout through `chatgpt-handoff-pilot`, `update-project-status`, `system-status-update`, and `system-handoff` instead of replacing those owners.

### System Status / Handoff Layer

- Status: `stable`
- `system-status-update` owns system-level status-first linked refresh and produces the concise status baseline for handoff.
- `system-handoff` is the handoff receiver and handoff output boundary owner.
- This refresh uses the `2026-06-08` status baseline before updating `docs/HANDOFF.md`, preserving phase consistency with the handoff document.
- Current-state SSOT remains the `docs/status/skill-hub-status.md` plus `docs/HANDOFF.md` pair unless a maintainer explicitly declares another current-state SSOT.

### Review Tooling Layer

- Status: `stable-to-evolving`
- Review tooling remains outside this closeout's write scope.
- DeepSeek review configuration has completed its closeout path before this P1 status refresh.
- P1-A and P1-C DeepSeek reviews returned `[]`; P1-B received a low-severity note that was addressed before merge.
- Codex review feedback for P1-C was addressed by tightening the Skill Refactor example boundary; Codex re-review found no major issues before PR #17 merge.
- This closeout does not modify `.github/workflows/`, review actions, adapter logic, index logic, sync/export/import/check tools, or tests.

## Current Phase

- System phase: `Phase 3 - Controlled System`.
- Closeout state: P0 asset entrypoint cleanup, DeepSeek review configuration, and P1 examples coverage are merged and complete.
- Completed P1 rounds:
  - P1-A: `chatgpt-handoff-pilot` invocation examples, PR #15, commit `8a734ff`.
  - P1-B: `project-takeover` invocation examples, PR #16, commit `ae97ab4`.
  - P1-C: `skill-governance` invocation examples, PR #17, commit `fd6cf10`.
- Phase judgment: the system is no longer in P1 examples coverage construction.
- Direction: keep P1 closed; any next work should start as a separate P2 planning / backlog-selection round, not as extra P1 examples work.
- Freshness gate: previous status date was `2026-06-08`; this refresh on `2026-06-11` is within the `14`-day freshness gate, so no staleness warning is added.

## Capabilities

- Reusable prompt entrypoints are clearer and easier to invoke.
- Heavy task-package template structure can be discovered from `templates/`.
- Project-level dual-refresh prompting belongs to `workflow-bootstrap`.
- System-level status-first linked refresh belongs to `system-status-update`.
- `system-handoff` is explicitly the receiver for a status baseline and the owner of handoff output boundaries.
- GitHub PR bootstrap authorization flags now align with the canonical orchestration contract: `commit`, `push`, `pr`, and `comment`.
- P1 examples now cover `chatgpt-handoff-pilot`, `project-takeover`, and `skill-governance` invocation surfaces.
- `skill-governance` batch evaluator wording is now explicit as read-only sequential evaluation, not batch rewrite.
- The Skill Refactor example boundary now keeps scripts, tests, registry/index files, workflow configuration, `.agents`, tools, prompt bodies, templates, and other skills outside the refactor entry.

## Stability

- Overall maturity: `evolving`
- Stable: canonical ownership in `skills/`, thin adapter / wrapper discipline, status-first linked refresh ordering, and handoff phase consistency.
- Stable boundary: this round is post-merge status / handoff closeout; it does not change runtime tools.
- Stable boundary: this round does not modify adapters, `.agents/skills/*`, GitHub entrypoints, `.github/workflows/*`, tools, tests, skill examples, prompt bodies, templates, protocols, registry/index files, or other skills.
- Stable boundary: `workflow-bootstrap` owns project-level orchestration; `system-status-update` owns system-level status-first linked refresh; `system-handoff` owns handoff receiver / output boundary; `financial-data-project-migration` keeps assessment and execution separated, with templates representing generated-output structure rather than skill behavior.
- Not yet stable: P2 planning / backlog selection has not started, and cross-skill executor consistency should continue to be observed through future real outputs.

## Risks / Gaps

- Do not reopen or widen P1 examples coverage in this line.
- Do not mix P2 planning or backlog selection into this closeout PR.
- Do not drift into `.agents` wrapper changes, workflow changes, registry/index/tools changes, prompt body / protocol changes, or large skill restructuring.
- Bridge mirror files updated in this closeout remain semantic mirrors of the active HANDOFF/status facts and must not become current-state SSOT.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Treat P1 examples coverage as closed.
2. Open any P2 work only as a separate planning / task-package round.
3. Keep P2 planning read-only until backlog selection and scope are explicit.
4. Preserve the current boundaries: no workflow, `.agents`, tools, registry/index, prompt body, protocol, example, template, or broad skill restructuring changes in this closeout line.
